Hi, I'm Antoine, a french software engineer located in Saint Dizier in great eastern france.
I'm interested in whatever implies cryptography. I usually work in C, Python and ocaml.
I sometimes enjoy database engineering and guitar pedals electronics.

Find me on a rugby field or behind a drumkit if I'm not behind my computer 🏉🥁 .
